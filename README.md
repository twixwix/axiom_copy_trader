- **RPC_URL_PUMP_FUN**: The RPC URL used for transactions on Pump.fun.
- **RPC_URL_RAYDIUM**: The RPC URL used for transactions on Raydium.
- **WALLET_PUBLIC_KEY**: Your Solana wallet public key.

- **ALLOW_REBUY**: Defines whether the bot is allowed to rebuy the same token (`true` or `false`).
- **MAX_BUY_ATTEMPTS**: The maximum number of times the bot will retry a failed buy transaction before giving up.
- **DEBUG**: If set to `true`, it enables detailed logs, including packet logs from WebSockets, for debugging purposes.

4. Obtain your authentication token:
   You can obtain the authentication token by opening the Axiom.trade website in Google Chrome, going to the **Network** tab in Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I), and finding the first request that returns the token.

5. Add your authentication token to `cookie.txt`:
   ```
   auth-refresh-token=your_refresh_token_here; auth-access-token=your_access_token_here;
   ```

## Enabling Raydium Buy Transactions (Experimental)

By default, buy transactions for tokens on Raydium are **disabled** because they have **not been tested deeply**. If you want to enable it, uncomment the following line in the code at **line 433**:

```python
# 'buy': lambda: sell_token('ra', token_name, token_address, max_slippage),
```

## Usage

Run the bot with:
```sh
python main.py
```
